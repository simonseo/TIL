#Stories I gathered from around the world
These are stories told by my friends, and some of them may have been 100% made up!

##Bulgaria
In Bulgaria, people nod their head up and down to mean no and shake their heads sideways to mean yes. This is because Bulgaria is traditionally a Christian state that was once conquered by a neighbouring Muslim state. The conquerors would ask the conquered people if they are Muslim. If they said yes, their life would be saved. If they said no, they would be killed. In order to live, the people had to withold the pain of lying about their belief. So most people preferred to preserve their life by nodding their head and saying that they are Muslim, but deep inside they were saying "No, I'm Christian." Ever since then, they nod when they mean no.
